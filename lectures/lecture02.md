## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

### 1. What is Version Control?
- Tracks file changes like a time machine  
- Supports collaboration  
- Allows comparisons, rollback, parallel development  

### 2. Git vs GitHub
- **Git**: Local version control system

- Track, compare, and restore files  
- Commit: Save snapshots of project state  
- Push/Pull: Sync changes with remote  
- Branching: Isolate features or fixes  

### 5. Git Commit, Branching, HEAD
- Use `git commit` to capture project state  
- Create branches to develop without impacting main  
- HEAD points to the active branch  

### 6. GitHub Collaboration Basics

- Clone remote repo locally  
- Pull updates from team members  
- Fork and create pull requests for collaboration
